    <h3>
        Inline codes are codes that deal with the text lines, like (b) or (strong). They change what the lines say.
          <em>
            (I'm using parentheses because if I use the actual signs, they won't show up)
          </em>

    <h3>
        Examples of inline are: <b>(b) or (strong)</b> for bold, <em>(em)</em> for italics, <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VN3wMIvsAPKO9_9bkVfxqKaR4XOrg94-inKLrXwCfus/edit>(a)</a> and (img)<img src="" for adding links and photos, and (br), which ends an existing line

  <h3>
        The other type of programming is Block, which forms an invisible box around the said text. The block htmls I've learned so far are (p),(form), and (div), which all start a new "paragraph". They separate text from other text in different manners

      <h3>
        There are also different types of tags, like (form) or (br). They are called Void tags, because they contain no closing tags.</form>Computers are considered stupid because coding has to be exact for them to cooperate. If the code isn't correct, the
        code will not show up correctly. Also, HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language
